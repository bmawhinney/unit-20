## system management activities
System management maintains the systems that keep a business operational and running efficiently. Making sure that each system can work independently and work well with other related systems.

Management activities can inculde.

Performing checks on applications in the system. Documenting any changes to them, troubleshooting if needed and seeing if the user experience can be enhanced. Making sure that applications are up to date.

Managing the hardware and software lifecycle. With planning and procurement to the decommission of the asset. Making sure that the company is following the licensing rules for different software. Checking that hardware is safe to use.

Using Automation to monitor and carry out management functions.

Estimating the amount of resources will be needed over periods of time. Resources like room space, hardware, software, power, connectivity infrastructure and data storage.

Making sure that any changes made are approved and documented.

Checking that the cloud storage is working and secure.

Checking that the company is following all industry and goverment regulations as specified in its compliance framework.

Knowing how the systems are configured and how they relate to one another.

Checking that data is being organised well. Created, retrieved, updated and stored. Backups are made and that data can be recovered from disasters as fast as possible.

Checking that the help desk can report, track and find resoloutions to problems effiently.

Checking that the network's performance is good and the security is working and stopping threats.

Checking that the overall security of the system is up to date and is doing everything it needs to in order to be secure.

## System maintenance and disaster recovery procedures

### Computer maintenance.

Cleaning the keyboard, mouse and monitor.

Removing dust in the computer to prevent overheating and replacing parts.

Making backups of importent data and storing them safely.

Disk deframentation and cleanup to impove performance and to get more storeage space.

Updating important software to improve performance and security.

Updating the operating system to improve performance and security.

Performing antivirus scans to check for malware.

### Disaster recovery.

Disaster recovery is the recovery and moving of data whenever natural disasters, equipment failure or cyber attacks happen.

Making and storing backups of impotant data is needed for when this happpens.

A cold site is when a company have a basic second facility that provides a place for employees to work after a natural disaster to allow its business to continue. A hot site is a version of this that also maintains up-to-date data copies.

Disaster Recovery as a Service is a service that enables a company to move its computer procssing to a cloud infrastructure allowing the company to work even if its servers are down.

Virtualization can be used to backup data and operations or the entire computer environment on virtual machines unaffected by disasters allowing to automate some recovery processes.

## Tools

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual computer system in a layer removed from the hardware. It allows multiple different operating systems on a computer simultaneously. Any programs and libraries in a virtual system are unique to it and unconnected to the main operating system.

A system image is a complete copy of everything on a computer's hard drive including the operating system and settings. If a hard drive crashes or the compute stops working the system image can restore everything without the need to reinstall anything.

Remote access is the ability for a authorized person to access a computer or network from any distance through a network connection. It is used for accessing devices and disagnosing and fixing problems without having to go to the device.
