## system management activities
System management maintains the systems that keep a business operational and running efficiently. Making sure that each system can work independently and work well with other related systems.

Management activities can inculde.

Performing checks on applications in the system. Documenting any changes to them, troubleshooting if needed and seeing if the user experience can be enhanced. Making sure that applications are up to date.

Managing the hardware and software lifecycle. With planning and procurement to the decommission of the asset. Making sure that the company is following the licensing rules for different software. Checking that hardware is safe to use.

Using Automation to monitor and carry out management functions.

Estimating the amount of resources will be needed over periods of time. Resources like room space, hardware, software, power, connectivity infrastructure and data storage.

Making sure that any changes made are approved and documented.

Checking that the cloud storage is working and secure.

Checking that the company is following all industry and goverment regulations as specified in its compliance framework.

Knowing how the systems are configured and how they relate to one another.

Checking that data is being organised well. Created, retrieved, updated and stored. Backups are made and that data can be recovered from disasters as fast as possible.

Checking that the help desk can report, track and find resoloutions to problems effiently.

Checking that the network's performance is good and the security is working and stopping threats.

Checking that the overall security of the system is up to date and is doing everything it needs to in order to be secure.

## System maintenance and disaster recovery procedures

### Computer maintenance.

Cleaning the keyboard, mouse and monitor.

Removing dust in the computer to prevent overheating and replacing parts.

Making backups of importent data and storing them safely.

Disk deframentation and cleanup to impove performance and to get more storeage space.

Updating important software to improve performance and security.

Updating the operating system to improve performance and security.

Performing antivirus scans to check for malware.

### Disaster recovery.

Disaster recovery is the recovery and moving of data whenever natural disasters, equipment failure or cyber attacks happen.

Making and storing backups of impotant data is needed for when this happpens.

A cold site is when a company have a basic second facility that provides a place for employees to work after a natural disaster to allow its business to continue. A hot site is a version of this that also maintains up-to-date data copies.

Disaster Recovery as a Service is a service that enables a company to move its computer procssing to a cloud infrastructure allowing the company to work even if its servers are down.

Virtualization can be used to backup data and operations or the entire computer environment on virtual machines unaffected by disasters allowing to automate some recovery processes.

## Tools

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual computer system in a layer removed from the hardware. It allows multiple different operating systems on a computer simultaneously. Any programs and libraries in a virtual system are unique to it and unconnected to the main operating system.

A system image is a complete copy of everything on a computer's hard drive including the operating system and settings. If a hard drive crashes or the compute stops working the system image can restore everything without the need to reinstall anything.

Remote access is the ability for a authorized person to access a computer or network from any distance through a network connection. It is used for accessing devices and disagnosing and fixing problems without having to go to the device.

Asset management is software that allows companyies to automatically monitor, track and categorise different types of assets in real time. It is used for tracking assets over multiple locations, optimising asset effectivness, reducing the chance of losing or damageing assets, having more accurate info on assets.

A ticketing system is software designed to manage and track customer support requests. It streamlines the process of fixing customer issues. It allows customers to submit requests from different channels. It makes assigning and tracking requests easier and more efficient. It can give pre made responses for common requests saving time for employees.

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop sharing system that enables someone to control another computer in a different location. It is used for making changes on a remote computer quickly IT support teams use it to troubleshoot employees computers remotely. It is used to make updating computers and software easier and faster. It can be used on low power hardware and can be used by many different operating systems.

A known error database is a database that tracks and describes all known error that are in the system. The databases typically include: descriptions of how and when the issue will appear, screenshots of incidents, the error messages, any temporary solutions that help with handling the problem, if the problem has occurred before and if it has been fixed before. The database helps with finding out how common any error is and can help with giving consistent solutions to problems. 

Security software is any type of software that helps to protect computers and networks. It is used for blocking unauthorised users and stopping attacks from the internet. Anti-virus, firewalls and malware protection software fall into this catagory of software.

A software update is a set of changes to software that update, fix or improve it. Updates are usually done to fix bugs, fix security vulnerabilities or improve usability. Any devices using older versions of software are more vulnerable to malware attacks. Depending on the software, updates are installed manually or automatically.
